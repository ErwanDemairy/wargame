Process of startup. Let's imagine the following startup:

1: You create some widgets
2: You add them to a window
3: You add the window to a scene
4: You start the scene

How are things drawn?


The engine tells the scene to draw itself.
The scene loops through it's nodes and draws them.

This means that the window has an an image at that point.

When the window is created, it asks it's container to draw itself.
A container is exactly that: a Horizontal or Vertical.
We could have an ImageNode here as well.

As the container builds the image, it asks the widget to draw itself if the image is None.
In a gui, all ImageNodes have an image already, but they contain a simple build_image() that can be overwritten.

How is spacing done?

A container merely puts extra content outside the widget.

A container is able to ask the question "what is my minimum size".
When a container is asked to render itself, it receives the size it can render to. The smallest size passed will be the minimum size it cn be rendered to.

Therefore there are 2 possibilities:

    1: The size is the minimum. In this case, just render all the node children.
    2: We have more space. In this case, the container will fill all the space.

If we have more space, it may or may not get consumed by the child nodes. So we drill down those first.
