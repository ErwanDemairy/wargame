# Wargame Engine

You can install the wargame-engine project on your computer with pip.

From this directory, enter the following command:

    pip install -e . --no-deps

This has been tested on Ubuntu 16.10, Linux Mint 18 and Max OS Sierra.
Once this has been done, you should be able to run the sample code listed in ./wargame-examples, in the parent directory of this file.

Feedback / bugs etc can be sent by using either the github repository (https://github.com/maximinus/wargame) or sent via email to *maximinus@gmail.com*.
